# Banking System
A basic banking system project, written in C++. 


## Login:
You can either log in, or create a new account. Accounts can be found in "users.dat".
Layout is as such:
username,password,account_type,balance,admin
Admins can do more than normal users, of course, so sign in as admin to have extra perks.

username: mark

password: password

(the above is an admin)
